<!--
set atttribute with id to html
when releasing drag n drop then get id of the element on which it was dropped

or

make it so when you drag it automatically replaces ( i dont think it is a very good idea o rmb it is but it has to detec which and where at realtime
also it means adding new State as DRAGGING in noteState
-->
